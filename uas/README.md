# Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) – Reference Configurations

This directory contains **reference ArduPilot parameter files**
for specific UAS platforms and flight controllers.

⚠️ **Important**
- Parameter files are **hardware-specific**
- UART mappings, power rails, and peripherals differ by controller
- These files are provided **for reference only**

Do **not** load a parameter file unless you understand the
implications and have verified compatibility with your hardware.
